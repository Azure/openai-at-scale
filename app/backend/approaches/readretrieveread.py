# Attempt to answer questions by iteratively evaluating the question to see what information is missing, and once all information
# is present then formulate an answer. Each iteration consists of two parts: first use GPT to see if we need more information, 
# second if more data is needed use the requested "tool" to retrieve it. The last call to GPT answers the actual question.
# This is inspired by the MKRL paper[1] and applied here using the implementation in Langchain.
